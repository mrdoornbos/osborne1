This repository chronicles my journey to restore a 1981 Osborne 1, one of the earliest portable computers, to its full operational glory. It contains ROMs, CP/M disk images, and detailed documentation on hardware repairs, software recovery, and troubleshooting, all aimed at preserving this iconic piece of computing history. From refurbishing the 5.25" floppy drives to recovering vintage software, every step of the process is documented to share with the retro-computing community and inspire others to revive their own Osborne 1.
